In short, a skeptic is anyone who wishes to base their beliefs on evidence. Dr. Steven Novella of [The Skeptics Guide to the Universe][1] podcast offers a complete definition below:

> A skeptic is one who prefers beliefs and conclusions that are reliable and valid to ones that are comforting or convenient, and therefore rigorously and openly applies the methods of science and reason to all empirical claims, especially their own.
> 
> A skeptic provisionally proportions acceptance of any claim to valid logic and a fair and thorough assessment of available evidence, and studies the pitfalls of human reason and the mechanisms of deception so as to avoid being deceived by others or themselves.
> 
> Skepticism values method over any particular conclusion.
